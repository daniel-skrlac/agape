### ðŸš€ Usage Guidelines

Development Flow:

- Screens â†’ Add to `app/(tabs) `directory
- Reusable UI â†’ Create in `components/`, keep components organised, use understandable names
- Static files â†’ Place in appropriate `assets/` subdirectory
- App constants â†’ Define in `constants/`, all strings should be defined here for easyer translation
